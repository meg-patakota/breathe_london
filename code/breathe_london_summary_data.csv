In the autumn 2021 a group of locals got together and created a community group 'Clean Air Bayswater’  to find a way to reduce the air pollution levels in our area.
We applied for and were very pleased  to be granted a Breathe London air pollution monitor, which will enable us to track and address air pollution in our local area.
We have developed a 12 month local community campaign to raise awareness among residents, businesses, schools and GPs of air pollution and how it impacts our health, irrespective of our age. This will involve a school education programme,  community events for residents and local business engagement activities.
Our aim is to improve the air we breathe by asking everyone living or working in Bayswater to join in, and take some simple steps to reduce air pollution in our area.  We are looking to work with other clean air groups to collaborate and share learning, so that we can all make as big a difference as possible.
We will also be looking for Westminster City Council to take action to support our campaign and actively reduce key issues such as idling.  
We believe that together we can make a difference.   Air pollution affects our lungs, heart and brains. We need to take action now. There is no excuse - The Clean Air Bayswater Group

It was formed in 2001 as a merger of Victoria Park Harriers (founded in 1926) and Tower Hamlets Athletics Club (founded in 1976). The club is open to all regardless of ability from the age of 9 upwards and coached training sessions occur at St. Augustine’s Hall, Mile End Stadium and the London Marathon Community Track at least twice a week. The active membership of approximately 450 athletes includes track, field, road and cross-country athletes, from beginners to Olympians. The club reflects the diversity of East London and has close links to local schools through our junior athletes.

While Mile End Stadium and the London Marathon Community Track are both over 50 metres away from busy roads and thus classified as urban background locations, St. Augustine’s Hall is about 20 metres from the A106, close to the junction with the A12, which results in poor air quality, as reported by the Breathe GB campaign, which found that St. Augustine’s Hall had the worst air quality of any sports facility in England with an average of 67 µg/m3 of NO2 and 17 µg/m3 of PM2.5 in 2018.

The Club is looking forward to using the data from the Breathe London node, which will improve the ability of Club members and local residents to avoid high pollution episodes and provide them with the data necessary to advocate for measures to improve local air quality.

After spending two years visiting the park every day with her toddler, she became increasingly concerned about the air quality in the children’s playground and the effect it could be having on her son’s health. This area of the park backs onto the North Circular / A406 where it meets a major interchange with the M11 at the Charlie Brown’s Roundabout. After weeks of research she found that there were no air monitors provided by the local authority in the nearby vicinity, and that there was very limited data recorded specifically in parks and play areas relating to air pollution. Lydia joined clean air campaign group Mums for Lungs and reached out to a number of community groups, schools, environmental projects and parents in the local area to raise awareness about this issue. With their support she put together a short film to apply to the Breathe London Community Programme for this air quality node. The data will be used to inform whether further mitigation measures are needed to protect park and playground users from the motorway’s toxic air.",300.0,charging,80.0,4-excellent,OK,healthy,ARY39ZDQ,2022-03-22T10:42:37.717Z,,2023-11-15T09:15:53.013Z,0,5,17.25358772277832,0,3.728382110595703,2,31,1,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Community Programme Y1,Solar,Y,"Community Programme, Deployed, Mums for Lungs Redbridge, Redbridge, Solar300, V2",Mums for Lungs Redbridge,Bloomberg Philanthropies,Nov 15 2023 11:00AM

The Brunswick Centre is between Russell Square (to the south-west) and Brunswick Square Gardens / Coram Fields (to the east). 
If we're WHO compliant, maybe that implies that the trees and green spaces nearby need to be even more positively promoted in other parts of Camden and London?
If we’re not compliant, is the issue commercial NOx or PM2.5 - from the shopping centre running through the Centre?

Although it enjoys the wildlife, biodiversity and picturesque setting that this green space provides, it is also situated on a busy road which runs under the M11 situated close by. Mums for Lungs Redbridge - a grassroots organisation made up of local residents all connected by a shared concern about air quality - was keen to work with the school to monitor levels of localised pollution coming from traffic on nearby roads and how this may be affecting the outdoor play areas of the school. 
 
Our group actively campaigns throughout the London Borough of Redbridge for more air quality monitoring in outdoor play areas and gyms, whilst also supporting parents to set up School Streets and raises awareness of the risks of idling car engines and wood burning. This monitor was secured by Woodford Green resident Rachel Southern in partnership with Mums for Lungs Redbridge Coordinator Lydia Fraser-Ward. Lydia was fortunate enough to receive an air monitor in Round 1 of the Breathe London Community Programme for the children’s outdoor playground in Elmhurst Gardens, South Woodford, which is located next to the North Circular.
 
The data from this Breathe London node will be used to inform the school and local residents of levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter in the area. This information will be highly valuable and will inform whether further mitigation measures are needed to reduce air pollution levels around the school, whilst raising awareness more generally with parents about air quality in the neighbourhood.

We have a water course running through the Park called the Wealdstone Brook and we are also measuring the pollution of the water on a regular basis (it was just appalling last year).

REACH (Residents Environmental Action on Climate and Health) is a sub group of the Hampstead Garden Suburb (HGS) Residents association with a number of key stated aims including ;
•        To support Suburb residents in preparation for environmental challenges by taking initiatives that will play a part in reducing our contribution to emissions and thus to the warming of the planet 
•        Consider actions we can take to reduce local pollution and enhance biodiversity.
•        Consult and co-operate with LB Barnet, HGS Trust, City of London, Transport for London, Environment Agency, and other relevant bodies as applicable.
•        Aim is to achieve Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions from the area by 2040 and to work with residents and relevant stakeholders to achieve this ambitious target.
Node location 

One key area of concern that REACH has identified within HGS is air quality (AQ) as the Suburb is bordered and dissected by some of London’s busiest roads, including the A40, the A1, East End Road and the Finchley Road. The lack of meaningful AQ data within the suburb means we can’t take steps to identify and address the root cause (whether it is vehicles, buildings, or wood burners), educate residents and inform change in HGS and the wider area. There is, perhaps, a preconception that there is no AQ problem in the suburb because it is indeed founded on the Garden City principles of open green spaces. However. Whilst there is an obvious impact on residents and businesses that border these roads it also creates and number of “rat runs”  Meadway is one of these roads, it is also part of the H2 bus route .",300.0,charging,69.0,4-excellent,,healthy,AKG6JFQH,2023-07-07T12:50:01.220Z,,2023-11-15T11:34:16.740Z,0,5,20.438129425048828,0,3.6479578018188477,2,24,1,0,0,0,23.0,1.0,Measurement,,,,,5.0,1.0,Measurement,,,,1,Community Programme Y2,Solar,Y,"Barnet, Community Programme, Deployed, Solar300, V2, with Host ",Residents Action on Climate and Health,Bloomberg Philanthropies,Nov 15 2023 11:00AM

Belvedere Road is a quiet road but it is regularly used by coaches and tour buses, which have bus stands along it.

The South Bank Business Improvement District (BID) was set up in 2014 to improve the management of South Bank in the face of increasing footfall and falling public spending. We fund and support several public realm services, including enhanced security, cleaning and litter picking, and help to promote South Bank as a leading visitor destination and as the cultural heart of London. We are a voice for South Bank businesses and provide a wealth of networking opportunities to the organisations in our BID area through event and networking programmes.

The work of South Bank BID is achieved by working in collaboration with others who share our vision for the future prosperity of the South Bank, including South Bank Employers’ Group, South Bank and Waterloo Partnership, the Visitor Management Group, South Bank Marketing and Venues Groups and South Bank Business Watch. South Bank BID is an independent organisation, governed by a Board of Directors drawn from a range of businesses within the BID area and who work to support all our levy paying members and to represent their views.

The concern is that high levels of particulates in unfiltered restaurant pollution might be putting residents at risk of a range of health impacts, including respiratory and cardiovascular risks. 
 
Legislation passed in 2021 now makes it illegal to emit visible smoke from a chimney. However currently the local council does not act on complaints.
The installation of an air monitoring node in an enclave of student housing, flats and houses protected from road pollution but vulnerable to pollution from charcoal burning in restaurants to both north and south (depending on the direction of the wind) is an interesting opportunity to assess the impact of restaurants on local air quality. 
The node will enable us to gather and disseminate crucial data, which we hope will raise awareness of any effect on public health of charcoal burning, and of the potential to improve air quality by means of filtration. 
If the impact of charcoal burning in restaurants is found to be a significant concern, we hope to use this data to set a precedent for communities across the country affected by the same issue so that we can more effectively campaign to our councils. It is also our hope that a case can be made for a scrappage scheme for extraction ducts that could result in a significant improvement in urban air quality. Such a scrappage scheme would help defuse the tensions that inevitably arise when one group asks another group to spend money on improvements.

Air pollution levels in Limehouse are amongst the highest in London and are the highest in LB Tower Hamlets by 30%.  The levels are recorded by an LBTH sensor (No35) located to the west of the Limehouse Link and Rotherhithe tunnel portals, and to the junction of Branch Road with Commercial Road, where excessive traffic congestion is common. 

The new Breathe London sensor is located in Branch Road on the east side of the pollution source where levels are likely to be higher than at the existing sensor due the prevailing westerly wind.

We have provided proposals to the authorities on how traffic congestion and hence pollution might be reduced at its source; and have obtained proposals by specialist consultants for a Green Infrastructure Masterplan, including air pollution reduction at its source and beyond.  The GI Masterplan would provide many other benefits such as active travel, community cohesion and enhanced biodiversity.

The additional sensor now located on Branch Road will be invaluable in providing further evidence for the approval of the measures necessary to reduce air pollution and to monitor subsequent improvements.
